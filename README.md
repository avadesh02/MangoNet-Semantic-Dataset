# The MangoNet Semantic Dataset 


The MangoNet semantic dataset contains images of mango trees in an open orchad and their correspoding semantic segmented images. The MangoNet semantic dataset has been used to develop a deep learning framework to automatically detect and count mangoes in an open orchad.

## Data description

The MangoNet semantic dataset contains 45 training images of size 4000*3000 and contains 4 test images of size 4000*3000. For each image the dataset contains a correspoding annotated image which is colored green in regions of mangoes and black in non mango regions.
